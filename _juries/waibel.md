Alexander is a Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh and at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany.

He is the director of the International Center for Advanced Communication Technologies (interACT) and Fellow of the IEEE Fellow. He and his team invented the “Time-Delay Neural Network” (now also known as “convolutional” neural network) which is at the heart of many of today’s AI technologies.

System breakthroughs that followed suit included early multimodal dialog interfaces, the first speech translation system in Europe and USA, the first simultaneous lecture interpretation system, and Jibbigo, the first commercial speech translator on a phone.

During his career, Dr. Waibel founded and built 10 successful companies.

Following the acquisition of Jibbigo by Facebook, Waibel served as founding director of the FB Language Technology Group. He also deployed speech translation technologies in humanitarian and disaster relief missions.
